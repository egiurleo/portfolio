👋🏻 My name is Emily, and my pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

I'm an engineering manager at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering), where I work with the Ruby & Rails Infrastructure team on [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/), the [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) and other tools to improve the Ruby developer experience. I am also an organizer of [WNB.rb](https://wnb-rb.dev), a community for women and non-binary Rubyists.
