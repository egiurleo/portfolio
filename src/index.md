üëãüèª Nice to meet you! My name is Emily, and my pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

I'm a software developer living in Lawrence, Kansas with my [husband](https://jonsamp.dev) and our two pets.

By day, I'm a Senior Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering), where I work with the Ruby & Rails Infrastructure team on [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) and other tools to improve the Ruby developer experience.

I am also an organizer of [WNB.rb](https://wnb-rb.dev), a community for women and non-binary Rubyists.

In my spare time, I enjoy [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/emilysamp) fantasy novels, writing, running, and playing music.
