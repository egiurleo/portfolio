I'm a software engineer living in Lawrence, Kansas. My pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

## What I'm up to

I am currently a Senior Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/), where I work on [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org)
and related tools to improve the Ruby developer experience.

I'm also co-organizing [WNB.rb](https://wnb-rb.dev/), a virtual Ruby community for women and nonbinary people.

In my spare time, I love to write and read speculative fiction. You'll often find me hanging out with my [partner](https://jonsamp.dev) and our pets.

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). I can't take credit for the idea, but I think it's pretty cool!)
