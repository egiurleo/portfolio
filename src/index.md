I am a software engineer living in Lawrence, Kansas. My pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

I am currently a Senior Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/), where I build tools to improve the Ruby developer experience. I'm also the co-founder of [WNB.rb](https://wnb-rb.dev/), a virtual Ruby community for women and nonbinary people.

In my spare time, you can find me reading fantasy novels or hanging out with my pets.
