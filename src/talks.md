<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">RailsConf • November, 2021 • Denver, CO</p>

So… how do we know when to use mocks in our tests? In this talk, we’ll identify three important questions that can help us make that decision. By the end of the talk, you will have a framework in mind to help you answer the question: to mock, or not to mock?
