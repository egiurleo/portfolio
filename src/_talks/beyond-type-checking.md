summary: |
  Many Ruby developers have remained skeptical of type checking, viewing it as unnecessary complexity in a language celebrated for its simplicity and flexibility. Behind the scenes, however, type checking advancements are driving dramatic improvements to Ruby developer tools.

  In this talk, we’ll explore how static analysis has the potential to enable Ruby developer tooling that is as intelligent, accurate, and responsive as state-of-the-art tooling for other languages. We’ll learn how these improvements will eventually benefit all Ruby developers — typing enthusiasts or not — and discover why the entire community should be excited about the era of Ruby developer tooling that’s now on the horizon.
