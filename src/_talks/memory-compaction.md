url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlpZPv1bp4g
summary: |
  Did you know that Ruby 2.7 introduces a new method for manual memory compaction?

  Neither did I.

  Then a user reported a bug on a gem I maintain, and well…

  In this talk, I’ll tell you a story about how one bug forced me to learn all about memory management in Ruby. By the end of this talk, you should understand how memory is allocated on the heap, how Ruby implements garbage collection, and what memory compaction is all about!
