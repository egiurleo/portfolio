summary: |
  Mocking: it’s one of the most controversial topics in the testing world. Using mocks, we can more easily test parts of our applications that might otherwise go untested, but mocks can also be misused, resulting in tests that are brittle or downright self-referential.

  So… how do we know when to use mocks in our tests? In this talk, we’ll identify three important questions that can help us make that decision. By the end of the talk, you will have a framework in mind to help you answer the question: to mock, or not to mock?
