summary: |
  I am the co-founder and co-organizer (along with Jemma Issroff) of WNB.rb, a virtual community for women and non-binary Ruby developers. Jemma and I started WNB.rb with the goal of supporting a more diverse group of people in making an impact on the Ruby community. In two years, it has grown into a community of over 600 technologists, with initiatives including a monthly meetup, book club, interview study group, conference proposal review group, and more!
