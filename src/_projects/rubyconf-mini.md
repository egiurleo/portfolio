  In the wake of the political changes making it unsafe for some community members to attend RubyConf 2022, I worked with [Jemma Issroff](https://jemma.dev) and [Andy Croll](https://andycroll.com) to organize an alternative option. RubyConf Mini took place in November 2022 in Providence, Rhode Island. It featured 30 sessions, with a heavy focus on inclusion and belonging.
