summary: |
  [FreeFrom](https://freefrom.org) is an organization that provides survivors of domestic violence with the tools they need to achieve financial independence. Working with other volunteers at [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org), I served as the [backend tech lead](https://github.com/RagtagOpen/freefrom-map-backend) for website that shows which states best support survivors' financial independence. Using this tool, activists can advocate for laws that help survivors recover from abuse.
