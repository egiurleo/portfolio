  [FreeFrom](https://freefrom.org) is an organization that provides survivors of domestic violence with the tools they need to achieve financial independence. Working with other volunteers at [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org), I served as the [backend tech lead](https://github.com/RagtagOpen/freefrom-compensation-api) for a website that helps survivors acquire financial compensation for the harm they endured.
