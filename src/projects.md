### [WNB.rb](https://wnb-rb.dev)

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">Ongoing</p>

I am the co-founder and co-organizer (along with [Jemma Issroff](https://jemma.dev)) of WNB.rb, a virtual community for women and non-binary Ruby developers. Jemma and I started WNB.rb with the goal of supporting a more diverse group of people in making an impact on the Ruby community. In two years, it has grown into a community of over 600 technologists, with initiatives including a monthly meetup, book club, interview study group, conference proposal review group, and more!

### [RubyConf Mini](https://rubyconfmini.com)

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">November 2022</p>

In the wake of political changes that made it unsafe for some community members to attend RubyConf 2022, I worked with [Jemma Issroff](https://jemma.dev) and [Andy Croll](https://andycroll.com) to organize an alternative option. RubyConf Mini took place in November 2022 in Providence, Rhode Island. It featured 30 sessions, with a heavy focus on inclusion and belonging.

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">June 2021</p>

[FreeFrom](https://freefrom.org) is an organization that provides survivors of domestic violence with the tools they need to achieve financial independence. Working with other volunteers at [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org), I served as the [backend tech lead](https://github.com/RagtagOpen/freefrom-map-backend) for website that shows which states best support survivors' financial independence. Using this tool, activists can advocate for laws that help survivors recover from abuse.
